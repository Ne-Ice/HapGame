##### How to run?
Now it's impossible. I haven't included here Esenthel Engine dll libs and game assets in `/Data` directory.
I haven't run it for over 5 years, as I remember it required DirectX 9.0c and some PhysX DLLs, and LUA libraries.
It also needed an old version of Esenthel Engine, really outdated for now.
If you want to run it, contact me, I'll try to help.
